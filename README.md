üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher

A Pinecone account and API key

A Google Gemini API key

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PulseAI-Your-Digital-Doctor.git
cd PulseAI-Your-Digital-Doctor

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up your environment variables:
Create a file named .env in the root of your project and add your API keys:

PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_PINECONE_API_KEY"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project
The project has two main parts: indexing your data and running the web application.

Step 1: Index Your Documents
Before you can ask questions, you need to process your PDF files and store their embeddings in Pinecone.

Place all your medical PDF files into the /data directory.

Run the store_index.py script from the terminal:

python store_index.py

This script will read the PDFs, generate embeddings using Gemini, and upload them to your Pinecone index (medical-chatbot-gemini). This only needs to be done once, or whenever you add new documents.

Step 2: Run the Web Application
Once your data is indexed, you can start the chatbot server.

Run the app.py script from the terminal:

python app.py

Your terminal will show that the server is running, usually on http://127.0.0.1:8080.
